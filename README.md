# tinymce.toolbarsticky
Tinymce editor toolbar ceiling plug-in, support setting the top reserved position, and focus display blur hide.

> Because of project requirements, the built-in ceiling function will obscure the navigation of the head. I searched through all the documents and found no configuration to avoid conflict.

So I wrote one myself, and then found that the top of the editor of `ckeditor5` was only displayed by `focus`, and `blur` would be closed automatically, so this function was added by the way

Release Notes

-2021-01-22 fix full screen conflict
-2021-01-23 Add a friendly error prompt when the reserved node cannot be found (the editor comes with a function)
-2021-01-29 Fix the calculation method of the ceiling. There was a bug in the previous , now it is accurate, and the function throttling of the `resize` and `scroll` event is added.
